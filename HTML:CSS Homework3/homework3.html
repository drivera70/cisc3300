3. Compare and contrast margin, padding, and border.

A border of a box is the line that separates the inside of the box from the outside of the box. Every box has a border, and it provides a division between the content inside the box, and the content outside of it. Padding is the space between the box's border and the content that resides inside the box. It ensures that the text inside a box does not run too close to the borderline, making the text clearer to read. Finally, margin is the space that sits outside a box's border. It creates space between the border of one box and another box that are placed next to each other.


4. Define the following flexbox css rules
a. Display: flex

This defines an inline or block flex container and enables a flex context for all of its direct children.

b. Flex-direction

This defines the direction in which items are placed in the flex container (can be vertical columns or horizontal rows).

c. Flex-wrap

This rule tells the flex box how to have the content wrap from one line to the next. Options are:
- nowrap (default), where all the flex items will be on one line
- wrap, where all flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from top to bottom
- wrap-reverse, where flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top

d. justify-content/align-terms

This rule defines the alignment of the flex items along the main axis of the box. It maneuvers the free space and flex items to fit a certain format.

e. Align-content

This aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis.
