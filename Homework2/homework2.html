<!--
1. Structural in HTML is referring to the overall layout and organization of the page, like what text is a header, which text should reside under each header, where there should be empty lines and where there should be text. Semantic in HTML refers to where emphasis should be placed within groups of text to provide better understanding to the reader. An example of this would be considering what text should be bolded, what text should be in quotation marks, etc.

2. It is important to use the correct HTML elements when designing web pages because using the incorrect elements would result in a confusing design for a page. For example, if you meant to use the <h1> element to give the page a large header, but instead used the <q> element, it would not be clear what the explicit purpose of the page is, and it may make users believe that the quoted text is an actual quote from someone. This would result in extreme confusion for the user, which is not ideal and could result in lack of revisiting to your website.

3. Forms in HTML are elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to you website. Their purpose is to collect and record information from the users that are visiting your website, with that information being stored elsewhere for the website creator to use. A form would be used when you need to collect your website visitors' email addresses to add them to a mailing list so they could stay up to date with your content/business.

4. Inline elements are elements that are placed in between certain characters in a block of text. The image, video, audio file, or other element would interrupt the text passage at a certain point with its presence, then the text would continue on the other side of the element. This is very different from a block element, which is an element that appears on a new line. Unlike how inline elements do not start on a new line and instead interrupt the text, block elements separate themselves from any previous text and inhabit a line only to themselves. These two elements provide very different structural feels to a webpage.
