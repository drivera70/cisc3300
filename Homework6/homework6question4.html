What is HTTP? What are the different HTTP request methods and how do they differ?

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is how the internet handles communication between clients and servers, and it is conducted through requests and responses. It is a client-server protocol, which means that requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the web browser. There are multiple types of request methods in HTTP. They are: get, post, put, patch, and delete. 
Get only ever receives data
Post submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server
Put replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload
Patch partially modifies a resource, but is not used as much as Post
Delete deletes a resource

What is an API? What is JSON?

An API is an Application Programming Interface. It is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is text data but JavaScript is ready to parse it into JavaScript objects or convert JavaScript objects back into JSON.
What is AJAX? What is meant by asynchronous code?
AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the entire page. Asynchronous code means running code in the background in a way so that it doesnâ€™t block the execution of other code. For example, with AJAX you can make a request to a server and then obtain the results from that request and run code with those results.
