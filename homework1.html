1. When a user connects to the web, it is an ISP, or an Internet Service Provider, that allows for the connection from their device to the web. ISPs like Verizon and AT&T are companies that provide services for accessing and using the Internet. When a user types a URL- a Uniform Reference Locator, a specific text address that points to a certain location in the Internet- their computer accesses the Internet through the ISP and contacts a DNS, a Domain Name System. A DNS hold all the IP addresses that are connected to the domain name requested when the user entered the URL. Then, the unique IP address that the DNS returns to the user's computer lets your computer access the website through its web server, the computer that is always connected to the web and is made specifically to send web pages to users. The web server sends the page back to the user, allowing them to access the page.

2. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a programming language used to write code that will be displayed as a website. It uses many tags and elements, and has a specific structure that allows for information to be clearly organized and presented in a website format.

3. Fordham's website uses structure in a number of ways to convey meaning and navigation options to the user. First and foremost, the title "Fordham University: The Jesuit University of New York" in the top left corner of the page is the largest text on the page, reminding the user what institution runs this page. Secondly, most of the text on the page is organized into boxes, giving the page an organized look that does not confuse the user. Beyond that, the words "About", "Mission", "Academics", and more written in large text on the top of the page offer different directions and locations for the user to navigate to if they are looking for information on one of those topics. The text on the page is not all the same color, as certain sections are written in different colors to further organize the text and prevent confusion. There is also a large, bolded word "SEARCH" in the top right corner of the page, clearly telling the user to navigate to that part of the page if they are looking for something specific.

4. An HTML element is an indicator made up of two tags that tells the browser something specific about the text that sits in between the opening and closing tag. A tag is a group of characters surrounded by angled brackets. An opening tag looks like this - <h1> - and a closing tag looks like this </h1>. Closing tags always have a forward slash in front of them. The tags tell the browser the text in between them are of some importance, which is decided by the text in between the angled brackets of the tag. An HTML attribute is an additional piece of text that may reside in the opening tag of an element. The attribute can assign a certain value to a variable, altering the structure of the page.
